# Reflection

This is my first time working with Django, VS Code, and GitHub, so the setup felt a little confusing at first. One of the main challenges I had was learning how to use the terminal in VS Code. I did not know that I had to activate the virtual environment every time before running commands. Because of that, some commands didn’t work, but after reading and trying again, I learned to check if the (venv) is showing in the terminal.  

Another challenge was connecting my project to GitHub. At first, I kept getting errors like “remote origin already exists,” and I didn’t understand what it meant. I solved this by asking for help and using `git remote set-url` to fix my connection. After that, I was finally able to push my code.  

Running the server was also tricky because I forgot to connect my app’s URLs to the project. It was frustrating at first, but once I fixed it, I could see my home and about pages in the browser. Overall, even if it was hard, I learned a lot from the process and I feel more confident using these tools now.
